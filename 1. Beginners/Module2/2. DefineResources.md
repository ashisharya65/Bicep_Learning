# Define resources

The main thing you'll do with Bicep templates is define your Azure resources. Here's an example of what a typical resource definition looks like in Bicep. This example creates a storage account named toylaunchstorage.

        resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-08-01' = {
        name: 'toylaunchstorage'
        location: 'westus3'
        sku: {
            name: 'Standard_LRS'
        }
        kind: 'StorageV2'
        properties: {
            accessTier: 'Hot'
        }
        }

Let's look closely at some key parts of this resource definition:

- The <b>resource</b> keyword at the start tells Bicep that you're about to define a resource.
- Next, you give the resource a symbolic name. In the example, the resource's symbolic name is <b>storageAccount</b>. Symbolic names are used within Bicep to refer to the resource, but they won't ever show up in Azure.
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-08-01 is the resource type and API version of the resource. Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts tells Bicep that you're declaring an Azure storage account. 2021-08-01 is the version of the Azure Storage API that Bicep will use when it creates the resource.
