# How Bicep works

- When you deploy a resource or series of resources to Azure, you submit the Bicep template to Resource Manager, which still requires JSON templates. 
- The tooling that's built into Bicep converts your Bicep template into a JSON template. This process is known as <b>transpilation</b>, which essentially treats the ARM template as an intermediate language. 
- The conversion happens automatically when you submit your deployment, or you can do it manually.
