# How Bicep works

- When you deploy a resource or series of resources to Azure, you submit the Bicep template to Resource Manager, which still requires JSON templates. 
- The tooling that's built into Bicep converts your Bicep template into a JSON template. This process is known as <b>transpilation</b>, which essentially treats the ARM template as an intermediate language. 
- The conversion happens automatically when you submit your deployment, or you can do it manually.

        Note:

        Transpilation is the process of converting source code written in one language into another language.


The latest versions of the Azure CLI and the Azure PowerShell module have built-in Bicep support. You can use the same deployment commands to deploy Bicep and JSON templates. For example, the following command deploys a Bicep template to a resource group named storage-resource-group:


    az deployment group create --template-file ./main.bicep --resource-group storage-resource-group
